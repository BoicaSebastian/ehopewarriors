The main purpose is to allow, to the highest possible extent, for the possibility of an adequate treatment in specialized centres, both in Europe, and globally. How so?

This was and still is a difficult chapter in our family's life, which we are crossing together with our little boy, Matti, aged 3, who is currently undergoing personalized treatment in a specialized paediatric oncology institute in Italy. Over the past months, we have also received support by donations in cryptocurrency, which has made Matti’s fight against the disease more accessible, and as the concept of a WEB3 space was already very familiar to us, the idea of exploring the utility of NFTs for charity purposes came naturally, particularly as we understand the potential behind the blockchain technology. Being aware of the real and urgent needs of a small fighter, in order to have the most effective and concrete results in the battle against cancer, we took the necessary action to develop a platform, financing the specialty treatment needed by many children, using blockchain technology.","text2":null,"text3":null,"text4":null,"text5":null,"text6":null,"text7":null,"text8":null,"title":"IDEA"},{"id":"ecosystem","VerientClassName":"bg-color2","text1":"Being from the same city where the ELROND ecosystem started, it was natural to start the project on their blockchain.We know and are aware that this WEB3 space, NFTs and crypto in general is a new concept for most people and it may be looked at with skepticism but we found great help from it, that’s why we strongly believe that we can use this technology for charity purposes and not just out of greed.","text2":null,"text3":null,"text4":null,"text5":null,"text6":null,"text7":null,"text8":null,"title":"ECOSYSTEM"},{"id":"goal","VerientClassName":"bg-color1","text1":"With the aid of the eHope Warriors supporters and through the projects leading team, we would like to offer the little fighters, as well as their families, the chance to receive personalized treatments provided by the specialized clinics with very good results in paediatric oncology throughout Europe.  We will be an aggregator of valuable information: in the area of childrens cancer treatment, on specialized oncology institutes, on funding sources, database of translators, legal professionals, as well as people willing to help in various ways. Moreover, we want to set a personal example, by financial, logistic, and information technology support, thus becoming a trustworthy guide for these difficult situations, full of unknown things, which the little cancer fighters go through.

According to the latest statistics, dated 2018, family doctors declared 569 new cancer cases in children aged between 0 and 19, having an incidence of 13.9% in this age segment, which represents 1.2% of the total new cases declared in Romania. One of the most important aspects we would like to emphasize, along with the presented information, is that, in Romania, treatments for children with cancer are insufficient, and specialized centres are untrained and insufficiently equipped, which renders the battle against this illness even more difficult. That is why we want to cover part of the above-presented needs, and thus to help as many children as possible to fight for their right to life!","text2":null,"text3":null,"text4":null,"text5":null,"text6":null,"text7":null,"text8":null,"title":"NEED"},{"id":"team","VerientClassName":"bg-color1","text1":"Our team is comprised of very special people who share our heart for helping, and for us they were and are a great help.

We will encourage the creation of Maiar accounts and the integration of conversions into FIAT, with a payment processor. We ourselves will make the first donation, from the foundations funds. Also, the NFTs from our collection, purchased by the supporters of the project can be donated here, as an auction, as well as works donated by various artists.","text3":"2.
